== Compilers ==

Overview section introduces the topic.
Introduction To Compilers - GeeksforGeeks: A Compiler is a software that
typically takes a high level language (Like C++ and Java) code as input and
converts the input to a lower level language at once. It lists all the errors if
the input code does not follow the rules of its language. [1]

What is a compiler? | Definition from TechTarget: A compiler is a special
program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code,
bytecode or another programming language. The source code is typically written
in a high-level, human-readable language, such as Java or C++. . [3]

What is Compiler? - W3Schools: A compiler is system software (a set of a
computer program) that converts source code written in a programming language
(source language, usually HLL) into another computer language (target language).
It processes every statement written in a particular programming language and
turns them to machine language. [5]

What is a Compiler? - Webopedia: A compiler is a program that translates source
code into object code to be understood by a specific central processing unit
(CPU). The act of translating source code into object code is known as
compilation. . What is compilation? [7]

== How It Works ==

This section covers how it works.
Compiler - Wikipedia: Compiler analysis is the prerequisite for any compiler
optimization, and they tightly work together. For example, dependence analysis
is crucial for loop transformation. The scope of compiler analysis and
optimizations vary greatly; their scope may range from operating within a basic
block, to whole procedures, or even the whole program. [2]

What Is a Compiler? (Definition, How It Works) - Built In: A compiler is a
program that translates high-level programming code into machine-readable code
that a computer can execute. It can help catch errors, optimize performance and
generate a binary file that runs on a specific platform. What is the difference
between a compiler and an interpreter? [4]

What is a Compiler? Definition, Phases, and Various Types - Techgeekbuzz: A
compiler converts a source code into an executable file containing the machine
code for computers to execute. Here, in this article, we shall discuss more
about the compiler and how it works. So, let us get started! What is a Compiler?
[6]

What Are the Advantages of a Compiler? - Reference. com: A compiler works
differently from an interpreter, though both are meant to achieve the same goal
of translating the high-level languages to a form that computers can understand.
. [23]

What Is a Compiler? (Definition, How It Works) - Built In: Compilers translate
code from a high-level programming language into machine code before the program
runs. Interpreters, on the other hand, execute high-level code line-by-line at
runtime, typically without producing a separate machine code file. [24]


== History ==

This section covers history.
What is a Compiler? Compilers in C Explained for Beginners: In the case of C
compilers, ISO (International Organization for Standardization) manages the
standards. As long as the ISO manages future C compiler standards, programmers
and companies can develop reliable software. Wrapping Up. Thanks for reading!
Now you understand: What a compiler is. The basic history of C compilers. [8]

History of compiler construction - Wikipedia: In computing, a compiler is a
computer program that transforms source code written in a programming language
or computer language (the source language), into another computer language (the
target language, often having a binary form known as object code or machine
code). The most common reason for transforming source code is to create an
executable program. [11]

History of Compilers - University of Wisconsin-Madison: History of Compilers The
term compiler was coined in the early 1950s by Grace Murray Hopper. Translation
was viewed as the "compilation" of a sequence of machine-
languagesubprogramsselected from a library. One of the ﬁrst real compilers was
the FORTRAN compiler of the late 1950s. [12]

History of Compiler Design - Medium: In this blog I'll be trying to shadow the
history of compilers in detail along with the basic introduction to compilers
and it's optimization. Starting with what a compiler is. [13]

PDF A history of compilers - ITU: • An abstract machine, a language, a compiler
- Three-address code with indirect addressing - Machine is realizable in
hardware but not built - Only assignments ; goto C is: - Compiler written in the
compiled language - Single-pass compilation of full-paren. [14]


== Recent Developments ==

This section covers recent developments.
Future Trends in Compiler Tools - csbranch. . is influencing the design of
future compilers. These new models offer novel ways of thinking about software
architecture, and compilers must evolve to support them. [41]

PDF Advancements in Compiler Design and Optimization Techniques: the most recent
developments in compiler design and optimization techniques on program execution
speed, memory utilization, and overall software quality is highlighted in this
study. The design of the compiler is advanced by the efficient code that is now
structured in research with high-speed performance without manual intervention.
[42]

: Heartbeat compiler. Joint work by Campanoni's Rethinks Compiler Abstractions
for New Applications (ARCANA) lab, Peter Dinda's Prescience Lab, and Umut Acar's
team at Carnegie Mellon University introduced the first compiler capable of
fully automating heartbeat scheduling, a granularity control mechanism used to
adjust parallelism at run-time. [43]

Next-Generation Compiler Technologies - Intel: We enabled many new compiler and
runtime optimizations to achieve leadership performance for HPC and AI
applications. Prefetching, async offloading, atomic-free reduction support,
optimal share-local memory, explicit SIMD, ND-range parallel execution, and
native fast math are just a few examples. [44]

- Wjert: The article "Recent Innovations in Language and Compiler Theory: An In-
Depth Analysis" provides an in-depth exploration of recent developments that
have shaped the landscape of language and compiler theory. [46]
