== Overview ==

Overview section introduces the topic.
Data Structures Tutorial - GeeksforGeeks: A data structure is a storage that is
used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so
that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. A data structure is not only
used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and
storing data. [1]

What is Data Structure? Types of Data Structures Explained - ScholarHat: A Data
Structure is the method of storing and organizing data in the computer memory.
It is the branch of Computer Science that deals with arranging such large
datasets in such a manner so that they can be accessed and modified as per the
requirements. [7]

What Is Data Structure? Definition, Types, Applications & More - Unstop: Data
Storage: Data structures provide a way to store data in an organized manner,
making it easier to manage and access the data efficiently. Data Organization:
They organize data in a structured format, such as linear (arrays, linked lists)
or non-linear (trees, graphs), facilitating easier data manipulation. [8]

What Are Data Structures? - Coursera: While data structures provide the
underlying organization and storage mechanism for data, algorithms dictate the
specific procedures and logic for performing data computations or operations.
Your choice of data structure directly affects an algorithm's efficiency. An
inapt data structure will likely introduce bottlenecks or functional failures.
[10]

Data structure - Wikipedia: A data structure known as a hash table. . In
computer science, a data structure is a data organization and storage format
that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. [11]
